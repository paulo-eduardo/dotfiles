# macOS Configuration Setup

This repository contains the configuration files and setup script to quickly configure a new macOS installation to my personal preferences.

It automates the installation of applications and command-line tools using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and sets up window management with [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps in order to set up a new Mac.

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub

Before you can clone the repository, you need to authenticate with GitHub. Using SSH is the recommended method, as it's secure and convenient.

**1. Check for Existing SSH Keys:**

First, check if you already have an SSH key. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see files named `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key and can skip to step 3.

**2. Generate a New SSH Key:**

If you don't have a key, generate a new one. The `ed25519` algorithm is recommended as it's more secure and performant. Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location. You'll be asked to enter a passphrase, which is optional but highly recommended for security.

**3. Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent:**

To ensure your key is automatically used for authentication, start the `ssh-agent` and add your key.

```bash
# Start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your private key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**4. Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:**

Now, you need to add the public key to your GitHub account.

-   **Copy the public key to your clipboard.** The command depends on your operating system.
    -   **macOS:**
        ```bash
        pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
-   **Go to your GitHub settings:**
    1.  In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
    2.  In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
    3.  Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**.
    4.  In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key (e.g., "My MacBook Pro").
    5.  In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
    6.  Click **Add SSH key**.

You are now authenticated to use Git and GitHub.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository into your `~/.config` directory. This location is intentionally chosen so that applications that follow the XDG Base Directory Specification will find their configurations automatically without needing symbolic links.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulo-eduardo/dotfiles.git ~/.config
```

### Step 2: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

`yabai` requires SIP to be partially disabled to allow its scripting addition to control windows, spaces, and displays.

**1. Boot into Recovery Mode:**
   - **Apple Silicon:** Shut down your Mac. Press and hold the power button until you see "Loading startup options". Click **Options**, then **Continue**.
   - **Intel:** Shut down your Mac. Hold down `Command (âŒ˜) + R` while booting.

**2. Open the Terminal:**
   - In the recovery screen, navigate to `Utilities > Terminal` from the menu bar.

**3. Disable SIP:**
   - Execute the following command in the recovery terminal:
     ```sh
     # This is the recommended setting for yabai, as it's less permissive than fully disabling SIP.
     csrutil disable --with-dtrace
     ```

**4. Reboot your Mac.**

You can verify the status after rebooting by running `csrutil status` in a normal terminal.

### Step 3: Run the Installation Script

The `install.sh` script will handle the rest of the automated setup. It will:
- Install Homebrew if it's not already present.
- Install all applications and tools listed in the `Brewfile`.
- Start the `yabai`, `skhd`, and `sketchybar` services.

Navigate to the configuration directory and run the script:
```bash
cd ~/.config
./install.sh
```

### Step 4: Manual Post-Installation Steps

After the script finishes, a few manual steps are required to grant permissions.

**1. Configure Passwordless `sudo` for Yabai:**
   - `yabai` needs to run a `sudo` command on startup to load its scripting addition. To avoid typing your password every time, you need to add a custom rule to `sudoers`.
   - First, find the exact path of your `yabai` installation:
     ```bash
     which yabai
     # It should output something like /opt/homebrew/bin/yabai
     ```
   - Now, open the `sudoers` file for editing (this is the safe way to do it):
     ```bash
     sudo visudo -f /private/etc/sudoers.d/yabai
     ```
   - Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with the output of `whoami` and `/path/to/yabai` with the output of `which yabai`:
     ```
     YOUR_USERNAME ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /path/to/yabai --load-sa
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor.

**2. Grant System Permissions:**
   - Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility`.
   - Enable access for `yabai` and `skhd`.
   - Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording`.
   - Enable access for `yabai`.

### Step 5: Reboot

A final reboot is recommended to ensure all services and settings are correctly loaded.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your Mac should now be fully configured. Enjoy!
