# macOS Configuration Setup

This repository contains the configuration files and setup script to quickly configure a new macOS installation to my personal preferences.

It automates the installation of applications and command-line tools using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and sets up window management with [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps in order to set up a new Mac.

### Step 1: Authenticate with GitHub

Before you can clone the repository, you need to authenticate with GitHub. Using SSH is the recommended method, as it's secure and convenient.

**1. Check for Existing SSH Keys:**

First, check if you already have an SSH key. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see files named `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key and can skip to step 3.

**2. Generate a New SSH Key:**

If you don't have a key, generate a new one. The `ed25519` algorithm is recommended as it's more secure and performant. Use your GitHub email address.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "pauloes.dev@gmail.com"
```

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location. You'll be asked to enter a passphrase, which is optional but highly recommended for security.

**3. Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent:**

To ensure your key is automatically used for authentication, start the `ssh-agent` and add your key.

```bash
# Start the ssh-agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your private key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**4. Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:**

Now, you need to add the public key to your GitHub account.

-   **Copy the public key to your clipboard.** The command depends on your operating system.
    -   **macOS:**
        ```bash
        pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
-   **Go to your GitHub settings:**
    1.  In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
    2.  In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
    3.  Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key**.
    4.  In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key (e.g., "My MacBook Pro").
    5.  In the "Key" field, paste your public key.
    6.  Click **Add SSH key**.

You are now authenticated to use Git and GitHub.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository into your `~/.config` directory. This location is intentionally chosen so that applications that follow the XDG Base Directory Specification will find their configurations automatically without needing symbolic links.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulo-eduardo/dotfiles.git ~/.config
```

### Step 2: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)

`yabai` requires SIP to be partially disabled to allow its scripting addition to control windows, spaces, and displays.

**1. Boot into Recovery Mode:**
   - **Intel Macs:** Hold down `Command âŒ˜ + R` while booting your device.
   - **Apple Silicon Macs:** Press and hold the power button until "Loading startup options" appears. Then, click "Options" and "Continue".

**2. Open the Terminal:**
   - In the menu bar, go to `Utilities` > `Terminal`.

**3. Run the appropriate command:**
   - **For Apple Silicon (macOS 13.x or newer):**
     ```bash
     csrutil enable --without fs --without debug --without nvram
     ```
   - **For Apple Silicon (macOS 12.x.x):**
     ```bash
     csrutil disable --with kext --with dtrace --with basesystem
     ```
   - **For Intel (macOS 11.x.x or newer):**
     ```bash
     csrutil disable --with kext --with dtrace --with nvram --with basesystem
     ```

**4. Reboot your Mac.**

**5. For Apple Silicon, enable non-Apple-signed arm64e binaries:**
   - Open a terminal and run the following command, then reboot:
     ```bash
     sudo nvram boot-args=-arm64e_preview_abi
     ```

**6. Verify SIP Status:**
   - You can check if SIP is disabled by running `csrutil status` in the terminal. The output should be `System Integrity Protection status: disabled.` (or `unknown` on some newer macOS versions).

### Step 3: Run the Installation Script

The `install.sh` script will handle the rest of the automated setup. It will:
- Install Homebrew if it's not already present.
- Install all applications and tools listed in the `Brewfile`.


Navigate to the configuration directory and run the script:
```bash
cd ~/.config
./install.sh
```

### Step 4: Manual Post-Installation Steps

After the script finishes, a few manual steps are required to grant permissions.

**1. Configure Passwordless `sudo` for Yabai:**
   - `yabai` needs to run a `sudo` command on startup to load its scripting addition. To avoid typing your password every time, you need to add a custom rule to `sudoers`.
   - First, find the exact path of your `yabai` installation:
     ```bash
     which yabai
     # It should output something like /opt/homebrew/bin/yabai
     ```
   - Now, open the `sudoers` file for editing (this is the safe way to do it):
     ```bash
     sudo visudo -f /private/etc/sudoers.d/yabai
     ```
   - Add the following line to the file, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with the output of `whoami` and `/path/to/yabai` with the output of `which yabai`:
     ```
     YOUR_USERNAME ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /path/to/yabai --load-sa
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor.

**2. Grant System Permissions:**
   - Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility`.
   - Enable access for `yabai` and `skhd`.
   - Go to `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording`.
   - Enable access for `yabai`.

### Step 5: Start Yabai, SKHD, and Sketchybar

After the installation and granting permissions, you can start the services for yabai, skhd, and sketchybar. The first time you run these, you might be prompted to grant additional permissions.

```bash
yabai --start-service
skhd --start-service
brew services start sketchybar
```

### Step 6: Hide the macOS Top Bar and Dock

To achieve a cleaner desktop experience, you can hide the default macOS top bar and dock.

**Hide the Dock:**
1. Go to `System Settings` > `Desktop & Dock`.
2. Turn on `Automatically hide and show the Dock`.

**Hide the Menu Bar:**
1. Go to `System Settings` > `Desktop & Dock`.
2. Under `Menu Bar`, set `Automatically hide and show the menu bar` to `Always`.

### Step 7: Reboot

A final reboot is recommended to ensure all services and settings are correctly loaded.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Your Mac should now be fully configured. Enjoy!
